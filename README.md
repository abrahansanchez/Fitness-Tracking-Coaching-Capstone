# Idea Number 2
# BarberConnect – Smart Appointment & Communication Platform for Barbers

## Project Idea 

**BarberConnect** is a full-stack web application designed to help barbers manage appointments and client communication in a more efficient, accessible, and automated way. It replaces the need for a “secretary” by offering both a visual dashboard for barbers and a phone-based voice menu for clients, using technologies like Twilio for voice and SMS automation.

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### Voice-Activated Menu (via Twilio Voice API)
Clients can call a number and interact with the following options:
- Press 1 to book an appointment
- Press 2 to hear availability
- Press 3 to cancel
- Press 4 to speak to their barber

### Client Interface (Web or Mobile UI)
- Calendar-style or list view of available times
- Simple, visual booking system
- Ability to cancel or rebook appointments

### Barber Dashboard
- Visual calendar of upcoming appointments
- Set custom hours and availability
- View and manage client info and bookings

### Appointment Reminders (via Twilio SMS)
- Clients receive SMS reminders 30–60 minutes before appointment

---

## Accessibility & Simplicity
- Designed for **elderly clients and non-English speakers**
- Language toggle (e.g., English/Spanish)
- Clean UI with large text and voice interaction

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- React.js for dashboard and client booking interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Optional: React Native / Expo for mobile version

### Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js for server and routing
- MongoDB for data persistence

### Integrations & APIs:
- Twilio Voice API – voice-based phone menu

---

## Real-World Use Case

Barbers spend time managing calls and reschedules during cuts. This app:
- Removes the need for a full-time assistant
- Allows clients to self-serve using a phone or web
- Saves time and avoids no-shows

---

## Future Business Model 

- Free Tier: 1 barber, limited SMS/month
- Pro Tier: Unlimited barbers, customizable prompts, branding
- Admin Portal: Manage teams in barbershops

---

## Capstone Requirements 

✅ Full-stack application  
✅ Real-world use case  
✅ External API integration (Twilio)  
✅ Authentication system  
✅ CRUD operations  
✅ MVP + Scalable features  
✅ Accessible design considerations



# Idea Number 3
# SmartReceipt   
**A Receipt Management System for Expense Tracking**

SmartReceipt is a digital platform built for individuals, managers, and business owners who want to streamline monthly expense tracking. It allows users to **scan physical receipts** and also **automatically import online purchase receipts**, organizing them in a centralized, searchable dashboard. Users will be able to **distinguish between physical and online receipts** for clarity during audits and exporting.

---

##  Key Features

✅ **Scan & Upload Paper Receipts**  
Use your phone camera to scan physical receipts and extract data like item name, amount, date, and vendor using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

✅ **Sync Online Purchases**  
Auto-import receipts from email or user-uploaded PDFs/screenshots. The system will identify and categorize them accordingly.

✅ **Separation of Receipt Types**  
Export files will clearly label whether a receipt is from an online purchase or a physical one, keeping audits clean and transparent.

✅ **Expense Dashboard**  
Visual summary of monthly or weekly spending categorized by type, vendor, and platform (in-store vs. online).

✅ **Search & Filter**  
Quickly search by store name, date range, amount spent, or item purchased.

✅ **Export to CSV/PDF**  
Download filtered data for budgeting or tax purposes with options to include or exclude receipt images.

## Real-World Problems & How To Solve Them

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Users lose track of small purchases | Receipt images & details are stored securely in one place |
| Difficult to organize physical vs. digital receipts | Label each by source; export formats distinguish them |
| Manual logging is time-consuming | OCR auto-fills data, email parsing handles digital purchases |
| Expense reporting is painful | Export clean CSV/PDFs with totals, categories & source labels |

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
